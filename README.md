# Mix-Tab
Mix-Tab is a chromium based web extension for managing the audio of tabs currently open in your browser.
Mix-Tab permits the user to increase the volume to double its normal output, or reduce it down to zero, balance a tab's EQ with a three band eq and control the pan (L-R balance) of the tab.

Mix-Tab also allows the user to mute all tabs, mute a specific tab while retaining its (unmuted) volume status and solo a tab (so its the only tab you can hear - all others mute during solo):



Mix-Tab automatically detects any page playing HTML5 audio and controls for those tabs appear in the popup immediately.
For non html5 audio, this can only be captured through a user action, and so requires users to press the load current tab button.

To install, download the zip folder link from the release, unpack it, go into the extension settings in chrome and select load unpacked extension (you will need to have developer mode turned on in the extensions page).
